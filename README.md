### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date ###

#### To create an analysis based on launch date, filterable by subcategory and year, it was first necessary to calculate the year for each record.  That was accomplished by adding a new column with the title 'years' and year forumala with creation date as the argument in each cell.

#### Next a new pivot table was created in a new worksheet, later renamed 'Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date'.  Filters were added on the 'Parent Category' and 'Years' fileds. The 'Outcomes'field was added to the Values and Columns to report a grand total and counts by outcome.  The date created field was added to rows, with the year and quarter elements removed to yield each month in a row.

#### The Parent Category filter was set to 'theater' to ensure the results were relevant to the project.  From there the line chart below was generated.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### The number of failed projects is relatively consistent throughout the year.  Both the total number of projects and the number of successful projects increase in the spring and early summer, specifically the months of May, June and July, in descending order.  Based on this, May would be the best month to launch for Louise to launch a campaign.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
