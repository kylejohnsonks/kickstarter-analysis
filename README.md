### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The number of failed projects is relatively consistent throughout the year.  Both the total number of projects and the number of successful projects increase in the spring and early summer, specifically the months of May, June and July, in descending order.  Based on this, May would be the best month to launch for Louise to launch a campaign.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
